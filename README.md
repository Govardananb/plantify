##🌱 AI Plant Detection & Advisory System (Frontend MVP)

A frontend-only Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that demonstrates how AI can help users identify plants, analyze their health, understand zone-based availability, and receive actionable care recommendations through a simple and accessible interface.

##🚀 Overview

This project showcases an AI-based Plant Detection, Health Analysis, and Zone-Aware Advisory System built as a frontend-only MVP.
Users can upload a plant image and receive simulated AI insights such as plant identification, health status, common growth zones, and improvement suggestions.

The MVP is designed for demonstration, learning, and portfolio purposes, with mock data simulating responses from the Gemini API.
